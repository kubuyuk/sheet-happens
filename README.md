# Web Automation Project

This project uses Python and Playwright to automate interactions with a website.

## Setup

1.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install the Playwright browsers:**
    This command will download the necessary browser binaries for Playwright to use.
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```

## Running the Script

Once the setup is complete, you can run the automation script:
```bash
python main.py
```
